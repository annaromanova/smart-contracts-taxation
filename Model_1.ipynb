We will use it for illustration of tax rules for smart contracts.\n",

    "A payment made using virtual currency is subject to information reporting to the same extent as any other payment made in property. For example, a person who in the course of a trade or business makes a payment of fixed and determinable income using virtual currency with a value of $600 or more to a U.S. non-exempt recipient in a taxable year is required to report the payment to the IRS and to the payee. Examples of payments of fixed and determinable income include rent, salaries, wages, premiums, annuities, and compensation:\n",

Therefore, payors making reportable payments using virtual currency must solicit a taxpayer identification number (TIN) from the payee.
