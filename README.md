The Basic tax clauses for smart contracts samples

The Basic tax clauses for smart contracts are sample Solidity blockchain contracts to help you to get started with blockchain development and integration on Ethereum. You can use the Basic tax clauses for smart contracts to create a blockchain contract that tracks, stores and processe tax data for the respective commercial smart contract.

The following information is provided to help you to get started with the Basic tax clauses:

Overview

The Basic tax samples are the smart contracts for getting started with writing blockchain contracts. The Basic contract includes operations for tracking tax data. The Basic tax samples are developed in the Solidity programming language. ormation, see Developing smart contracts for Watson IoT Platform blockchain integration.

The Basic tax samples code includes the following main methods:

Method	Description
deploy	Used to deploy a smart contract
invoke	Used to update a smart contract

Note: In the Basic tax contract samples, the deploy method is called init.

When you call any of the methods, you must first pass a JSON string that includes the function name and a set of arguments as key-value pairs to the chain code instance. You can define multiple methods within the same contract.

To create a simple contract to create, read, update, and delete asset data, use the following methods:

Method	    Provides
readSchemas The methods and associated properties of the JSON schema contract
readSamples An example of the sample JSON data
