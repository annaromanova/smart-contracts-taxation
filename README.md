Overview

The Basic tax samples are the smart contracts for getting started with writing blockchain contracts. The Basic contract includes operations for tracking tax data. The Basic tax samples are developed in the Solidity programming language. ormation, see Developing smart contracts for Watson IoT Platform blockchain integration.

The Basic tax samples code includes the following main methods:
